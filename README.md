🎮 Gameplay
The player controls a spaceship positioned at the bottom of the screen, moving it left and right by dragging.
The shooting is manual — the player fires lasers by tapping the screen or pressing a dedicated fire button.
The goal is to destroy incoming enemy ships, earn points and resources, and survive as long as possible.
The game follows a wave system, where each new wave increases in difficulty with faster and stronger enemies.
